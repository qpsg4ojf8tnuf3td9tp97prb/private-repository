anywaayzlicensebebroughthere_nd.justcode (v0)

here’s how this works:

you get everything.
i keep nothing.

i give up all rights that can be given up—copyright, moral rights, performance rights, the right to say “actually i made that,” and the right to be asked first. all gone.

you can:
- use this code
- change this code
- break it, fix it, fork it, forget it
- sell it, gift it, embed it in a toaster
- attribute it to your friend, your dog, or nobody at all

and in return, i promise... absolutely nothing.

no maintenance.
no support.
no warranty.
no roadmap.
no updates.
no replies to issues.
no regrets.

you take it as-is, and do what you like. if it works, great. if it doesn’t, that’s also part of the experience.

this work is now detached from me. use it well, or poorly. it’s yours.

no obligations. no strings. not even invisible ones.

—unless—

you’ve lost rights to any of my other works (for any reason, legal, magical, or otherwise). in that case, this license does not apply to you. at all. you may not use, copy, keep, or refer to this project in any form. it’s as if it never existed.

go make something,
someone who once cared enough to upload this
